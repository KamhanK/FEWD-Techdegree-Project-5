# Techdegree Project 5 - Interactive Photo Gallery

**Skills & Technologies Used:**

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- jQuery
- Google Fonts
- Flexbox
- Mobile-First Responsive Web Design

**Project Description:**

For this project I created all of the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript from scratch. I created an interactive photo gallery with the provided images and thumbnails for the "Lightbox" jQuery plugin. I arranged all the elements in the design with Flexbox. I used a Google font for all of the text of the website. I created a search input field for the JavaScript search filter. The gallery searches based on the captions of the images. I implemented a JavaScript list search filter from a w3schools search filter example. I implemented this search filter to search on the captions of the images and display the respective images based on the search criteria. I used a jQuery "Lightbox" plugin to display an overlay and a lightbox that can cycle through all the images of the photo gallery with their captions. I fulfilled the "exceeds expectations" requirements by using a mobile-first responsive design and by writing my own JavaScript code for a search filter, which I implemented from a w3schools list search filter example.

This project was designed according to the provided mockups.

**Exceeds Expectations Requirements:**

Include a mobile-first design for both the gallery page and the lightbox:

- Use media queries to make sure that the photos and layout adjust for a mobile-friendly experience.

Write your own JavaScript or jQuery code instead of using a jQuery plugin for the search/content filtering requirement.

**Grade Received:**

Exceeds Expectations
